# KeepMyFlow

A Chrome Extension that removes the distracting Hot Network Questions from Stack Exchange.

I found that I kept getting my flow interrupted by the tempting yet ultimately useless "Hot Network Questions" that Stack Exchange sites put up next to the answers section. So that I could keep focused on what I was actually trying to accomplish rather than getting nerdsniped by an interesting-looking but unrelated question, I created this Chrome Extension to simply remove that div from all Stack Exchange sites.

Really, it's that simple: just 2 lines of JavaScript.

# Installation

To get this for yourself, clone this repository and follow the instructions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).

Eventually I'll make this a packaged Chrome Extension so that you get it without having to download the source. On the plus side, having to upload the source yourself means you know I'm not doing anything nefarious :)
